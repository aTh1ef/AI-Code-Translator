# BridgeX - Chatbots Side by Side

BridgeX is a web application that showcases two chatbots side-by-side, enabling users to input text into the left chatbot and view AI-generated responses on the right. It uses Google Generative AI (Gemini model) to create dynamic responses.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure for both chatbots, input fields, and AI-generated response handling.
- `<style>`: Embedded CSS to style the chatbots, user interface, and chat messages.
- `<script type="importmap">`: Import map to import Google Generative AI.
- `<script type="module">`: JavaScript module handling user input and AI interaction, including sending user messages and receiving AI responses.

## Dependencies

- [Google Generative AI](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai): Requires an API key to access the Gemini model for generating AI responses.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): Utilizes "Material Symbols" for icons and "Inter" for font styling.
